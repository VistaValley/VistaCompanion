Vista Companion is built on the lightning-fast and incredibly versatile Fabric mod loader.  This means exceptional performance and compatibility with a massive library of mods. Customize the modpack with your favorite mods! ➕

🙌 **Join the Community: Open Source & Collaborative** 🙌

We believe in open development! Vista Companion is open source ([GitHub](https://github.com/VistaValley/VistaCompanion)), and so are many of the mods we include. We actively encourage community feedback to make Vista Companion the best it can be. 🤝
