🚀 **Vista Companion: Experience Vista Valley Like Never Before** 🚀

Tired of lag and clunky performance? Vista Companion delivers a blazing-fast Minecraft experience, no matter your device. We've hand-picked performance-enhancing mods like [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) to ensure smooth gameplay and rock-solid world stability. ⚡️

✨ **Enhanced Gameplay with Key Mods** ✨

Vista Companion isn't just about performance; it's about enhancing your gameplay. We've included essential mods like [PlasmoVoice](https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice) for seamless voice chat and [Bobby](https://modrinth.com/mod/bobby) for greater render distances, alongside a curated selection of other mods.

🎮 **Easy Access In-Game** 🎮

Access the [Vista Valley Wiki](https://wiki.vistavalley.xyz/) and our [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vista-companion) directly from the in-game pause menu and main menu for quick reference and updates.

✨ **OptiFine Features, Built-In** ✨

Enjoy shaders, connected textures, zoom, and more – all without needing OptiFine! Most resource packs designed for OptiFine are fully compatible with Vista Companion. 🎨

🛠️ **Powered by Fabric** 🛠️

Vista Companion is built on the lightning-fast and incredibly versatile Fabric mod loader. This means exceptional performance and compatibility with a massive library of mods. Customize the modpack with your favorite mods! ➕

🙌 **Join the Community: Open Source & Collaborative** 🙌

We believe in open development! Vista Companion is open source ([GitHub](https://github.com/VistaValley/VistaCompanion)), and so are many of the mods we include. We actively encourage community feedback to make Vista Companion the best it can be. 🤝
